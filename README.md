Hi I am Apurav Chandraknat Tambe. I am fifth year undergartuate student studying Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture, at IIT Kharagpur. I am an UG researcher interested in- Fluid flows. I am interested in dynamics of flows at smalll scales, specifically milimeterscale fluid physics. I work in the area of interfacial fluid physics in the context of drops,bubbles and jets! I mostly do analytical and experimental work but lately trying to learn numerical modelling as well!
